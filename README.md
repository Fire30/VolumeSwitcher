VolumeSwitcher
==============

Extension that allows you to change songs via the volume buttons in android. I will admit the source is a bit messy, but I have not seen any other Substrate Tweaks and don't know what to base it on. This only works when the screen is off, if someone want to help make it work in all states I would be grateful.

Prerequisites
=============
You must have Cydia Substrate installed and be rooted.
